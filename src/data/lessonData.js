For this reason, we encourage you to:\n\n• Double (triple) check that you’re following the pattern correctly before you cut your fabric.\n• Practice any steps that you feel unsure about on scrap fabric or even an old t-shirt that you have lying around.\n• Don’t be afraid of using your seam ripper if you want to start over or undo any of your stitches\n\nEach and every one of our fabrics are sustainably sourced. You can read more about the origins of your materials in the “Fabric Story” that comes in your kit.\n\nThese instructions use gray and pink to show the wrong side (the back side) and the right side (the side you want to be seen) of the fabric. Unless your fabric is printed or patterned, you may not see an obvious difference between the right and wrong sides. In that case, pick a side to call the right side and stick with it.",
